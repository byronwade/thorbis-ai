# Thorbis AI - Engagement Prediction Model 🤖

## Overview
Thorbis AI is a machine learning system that predicts and optimizes website content engagement. Think of it as a smart assistant that learns from how users interact with your website and suggests what content might work better.

## How It Works 🔄

1. **Data Collection**
   - Tracks user interactions (clicks, hover time, etc.)
   - Monitors how long users engage with content
   - Records which version (A or B) of content performs better

2. **Learning Process**
   - The AI analyzes patterns in user behavior
   - Learns what combinations of features lead to better engagement
   - Continuously improves its predictions through training

3. **Predictions**
   - Predicts engagement scores for content
   - Suggests which content variant might perform better
   - Provides confidence levels for its predictions

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant feedback on content performance
- **A/B Testing**: Automated testing of different content versions
- **Engagement Scoring**: Numerical scores for content performance
- **Smart Optimization**: AI-driven content recommendations

## Technical Details 🛠️

### Architecture
- Built with TensorFlow.js
- Uses deep learning with multiple neural network layers
- Implements both regression (scoring) and classification (variant selection)

### Model Structure
- Input Layer: 7 features (clicks, hover time, etc.)
- Hidden Layers: 128 → 64 → 32 neurons
- Output: Engagement score and variant prediction

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Training the Model**
   ```bash
   npm run train
   ```

3. **Running Predictions**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage Examples 📝

```typescript
// Initialize the model
const model = new EngagementModel();
await model.initialize();

// Make predictions
const prediction = await model.predict({
```
